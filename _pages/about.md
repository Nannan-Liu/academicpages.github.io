About me
--------

I am a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at Hong Kong Baptist University, working with Professor [Min-hua Liu](https://ctn.hkbu.edu.hk/people/min-hua-liu/). I got my PhD in Translation from the University of Hong Kong and BA and Master’s in Interpreting from Beijing Foreign Studies University (Běiwài). My research interests are interpreting studies, computational linguistics and cognitive linguistics. 

> From the irregular trivia of ordinary life mixed with a bit of scientific doodling and failure, to the intense dramatic concentration as one closes in on the truth and the final elation (plus with gradually decreasing frequency, the sudden sharp pangs of doubt)—that is how science is done ([Feynman 1967/2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfectly_Reasonable_Deviations_from_the_Beaten_Track)).
